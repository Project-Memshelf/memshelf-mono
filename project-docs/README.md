# Memshelf Overview

## What is Memshelf?

Memshelf is a **shared knowledge backend** that unifies your fragmented thoughts, notes, and ideas into a single, searchable, and collaborative knowledge base. Designed for the modern workflow where AI agents, humans, and various tools need seamless access to shared knowledge.

## The Problem We Solve

### Knowledge Fragmentation
- Notes scattered across multiple apps (Obsidian, Notion, Apple Notes, etc.)
- Ideas lost in chat conversations (Slack, Discord, WhatsApp)
- Research buried in different tools and platforms
- No unified way for AI agents to access and contribute to your knowledge

### Collaboration Friction
- Difficult to share knowledge across teams and tools
- No single source of truth for evolving ideas
- Manual synchronization between different knowledge systems
- Limited AI integration with existing note-taking workflows

### Search and Discovery Issues
- Knowledge exists but is impossible to find
- No cross-platform search capabilities
- Ideas remain isolated without connections
- Context is lost when switching between tools

## Core Features

### üîó Universal Knowledge Backend
- **API-first design** that integrates with any tool or application
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - works with CLI tools, web apps, mobile apps, and AI agents
- **Unified storage** for all your notes and ideas, regardless of source

### ‚úèÔ∏è Intelligent Editing System
- **Diff-based editing** for efficient, incremental updates (like Git for prose)
- **Conflict detection** prevents data loss from concurrent edits
- **Version tracking** maintains edit history automatically
- **AI-friendly** editing that works seamlessly with LLM-generated content

### üè∑Ô∏è Flexible Organization

- **Full-text search** across all content using Meilisearch
- **Tag-based filtering** for precise content discovery
- **Cross-workspace search** when permissions allow
- **Real-time search** with instant results

### ü§ñ AI-Native Design
- **API key authentication** designed for AI agents and automated tools
- **Structured data format** that AI systems can easily understand and manipulate
- **Incremental editing** perfect for LLM-driven content updates
- **Metadata-rich** responses provide context for intelligent processing
